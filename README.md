# ConfParser

A configuration parser written in python.

## Description

`ConfParser` is a configuration parser which I personally do not remember to
have written (and I do not recognize the code as mine). However, I have used
it in some code that I have written, and I cannot trace back its author, so I
have created this repository in order for it to be easily available (I was not
able to find it anywhere else). If you are the original author, you are
welcome to contact me to get proper credit and if you wish the entire
repository etc.
